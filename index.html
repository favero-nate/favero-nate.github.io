I am currently an associate professor in the <a href="https://www.american.edu/spa/dpap/index.cfm" target="_blank">Department of Public Administration &amp; Policy</a> within the School of Public Affairs at American University (Washington, DC). I also regularly serve as a visiting faculty member in the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University (Denmark). I received a PhD in political science from Texas A&amp;M University in 2016. My research interests include citizen satisfaction, performance, management, social equity, quantitative methodology, education policy, and systems-level models of public administration/policy.
